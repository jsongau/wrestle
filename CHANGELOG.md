# Changelog — MAT (Pro Wrestling Database)

## 2026-07-25
- Project kickoff. Wrote master brief (`PROJECT.md`): vision, IA/sitemap, SEO+GEO strategy, China market plan, membership funnel, tech stack.
- Ran 4 parallel research agents → datasets in `/data/` (41 wrestlers + 160+ relationship edges, 30 rated matches, 15 storylines, full design/SEO/GEO/China reference).
- Built single-file design system (`css/site.css`) — dark "arena" theme, mobile-first, all components (cards, rating meters, tale-of-the-tape, mega-nav, embeds/facade, tiers, forms).
- Built `js/main.js` — mobile nav, mega-panel toggles, facade video loader (YouTube+Bilibili), roster search/filter, waitlist form (in-memory, no browser storage).
- Built front page (`index.html`) with full mega-nav, hero featured match, five-star club, icons, relationship teaser, waitlist capture, GEO answer + FAQ.
- Built flagship templates: match page (Undertaker vs HBK WM25), wrestler page (The Undertaker), membership funnel (`membership/`).
- Dispatched builder-agent fleet for the remaining wrestler/match/rivalry/relationship/promotion/China pages, indexes, markdown mirrors, and SEO infra.
- Fleet delivered: 41 wrestler profiles, 30 match pages, 15 rivalries + index, wrestlers/matches/rankings/relationships indexes, 5 promotion hubs + index, about + methodology + growth-strategy, /zh/ + /zh/membership/ + /china/, robots.txt + sitemap.xml (103 URLs) + llms.txt, and /content/ markdown mirror.
- Verified: 104 HTML pages, 0 broken internal links, 0 invalid JSON-LD; rendered desktop + mobile + China screenshots as proof.
- Total: 173 files. Site is deploy-ready (pending real domain, verified video IDs, images, and a live waitlist backend).

## 2026-07-25 (v2 — Broadcast Bold homepage redesign)
- Ran 4 parallel design-research agents (visual, motion, typography, conversion) → playbooks in /data/design-research-*.md.
- Chose art direction: **Broadcast Bold** (ESPN/UFC/DAZN). Type system: Anton (display) + Oswald (condensed UI) + Inter (body).
- Wrote 12 per-section design specs in /docs/design/ (design-system + one per homepage section).
- Upgraded css/site.css (additive, non-breaking): layered "arena spotlight" hero, film-grain overlay, duotone poster tiles + monograms, gradient-border cards, pointer spotlight, metallic-gold shine buttons, marquee ticker, glass stat bar, angled seams, scroll-reveal (gated behind .js so content is visible without JS).
- Added js/enhance.js: scroll-reveal, count-up, hero parallax, card spotlight, sticky header — all reduced-motion + no-JS safe.
- Rebuilt index.html in Broadcast Bold; verified desktop + mobile renders (Google Fonts loaded). Delivered self-contained preview MAT-preview-home-v2.html.
